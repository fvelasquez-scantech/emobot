Sentiment Analysis with Real-Time Voice Input
This is a web application that allows users to speak into their microphone and receive real-time sentiment analysis feedback. The sentiment analysis is performed using a pre-trained machine learning model, and the audio input is captured using the user's web browser.

Getting Started
To run this application on your local machine, you will need to have Python 3 and Flask installed. You will also need a web browser that supports the Web Audio API.

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal.
Start the Flask server by running python app.py in your terminal.
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.
Usage
Grant microphone access when prompted by your web browser.
Click the "Start Recording" button to begin capturing audio.
Speak into your microphone.
The web application will display a real-time sentiment analysis of your speech as you speak.
Click the "Stop Recording" button to stop capturing audio.
How it Works
This web application captures audio input from the user's microphone using the Web Audio API in the user's web browser. The audio input is then sent to the Flask server for sentiment analysis using a pre-trained machine learning model. The sentiment analysis is performed in real-time, and the results are sent back to the user's web browser for display.
